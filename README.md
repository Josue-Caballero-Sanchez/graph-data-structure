# graph-data-structure

This project implements a graph data structure using JGraphT and Graphviz for visualization. It includes functionalities to create, modify, and query graphs as well as export them to DOT format and PNG images.

## Features
1. Graph Representation: Uses DirectedMultigraph from JGraphT to represent directed graphs.
2. Graph Parsing: Parses a DOT file to create a graph structure.
3. Node and Edge Management: Supports adding, removing, and listing nodes and edges.
4. Graph Export: Exports the graph to DOT format and PNG images.
5. Graph Search: Provides path search using BFS and DFS algorithms.

## Running JUnit Tests
To run the JUnit tests, use the following Maven command: mvn test
